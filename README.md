# Healthcare Spending Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global healthcare spending trends, comparing country-specific expenditures and deriving actionable insights using SQL and Power BI.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical trends in healthcare spending above the average.
- Compare total and per capita healthcare expenditures across countries.
- Visualize data to highlight patterns and disparities.

## Tools & Techniques
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and storytelling.

## Project Files
- **SQL Queries**: [healthdataquerry.sql](sql/healthdataquerry.sql)
- **Datasets**: [CSV files](data/)
- **Power BI Dashboards**: [Healthcare Spending Dashboard](dashboards/)
- **Visualizations**: [Screenshots](visualizations/)

## Key Insights
1. **Global Trends**: Healthcare spending significantly increased between 1970 and 2010.
2. **Country Contributions**: The USA contributes over 34% of global healthcare expenditures.
3. **Regional Disparities**: High per capita spending is concentrated in developed regions.
4. **Data Coverage**: Some countries have incomplete data, requiring careful analysis.

## Visualizations
1. **Line Chart**: Total spending above average (1970-2015).
