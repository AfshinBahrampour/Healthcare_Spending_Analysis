# Healthcare Spending Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of global healthcare spending trends, insights into country-specific contributions, and regional disparities using SQL and Power BI.

---

## Overview
This project examines healthcare spending patterns globally using historical data. Through SQL for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization, we reveal:
- Spending trends over time.
- Country-wise and per capita contributions to healthcare expenses.
- Regional variations and data completeness.

---

## Objectives
- Understand historical trends in healthcare spending above the average.
- Compare total and per capita healthcare expenditures across countries and regions.
- Highlight insights into data patterns and disparities using effective visualizations.

---

## Tools & Techniques
- **SQL**: For extracting and cleaning data.
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and storytelling.
- **Datasets**: Historical healthcare spending data for multiple countries.

---

## Key Insights
1. **Global Trends**:
   - Significant growth in healthcare spending between 1970 and 2010.
   - A noticeable decline after 2010.
2. **Country Contributions**:
   - The USA accounts for the largest share of global healthcare spending (34%).
3. **Regional Disparities**:
   - Developed countries show high per capita spending, highlighting regional disparities.
4. **Data Completeness**:
   - Some countries have incomplete data, which poses challenges for long-term analysis.
